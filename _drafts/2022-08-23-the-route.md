We are only 6 weeks away from our kayak trip. Last month I posted an entry about equipment. If anyone has bought any new equipment since that time could you please add a comment to [that entry](https://seanmyers.github.io/stonington/personal/2022/07/25/equipment.html) so we have a record of it. I know signing up for another service (Disqus) can be a pain but it would help keep a record of things.

I have laid out a tentative trial and camping site for our trip that considers several things including:
- we will get to Stonington in the afternoon on Friday
- we need to leave Stonington by 9:00 AM Sunday
- Saturday could be a destination oriented day that takes up most of the daylight (maybe a total of 6 hours including several stops).
- we can stay two different sites if necessary (one Friday and one Saturday) but one where we can leave gear may be helpful.

The map below shows two proposed trips. The solid blue lines depict the same trip Ben and I took a couple of years ago. It includes a shorter Friday and a longer Saturday with stays at Steve Island both Friday and Saturday nights.

The solid red lines show a trip proposed by the person who is renting us the kayaks (I will forward this email). The solid red route assumes we get there early enough Friday to make it out to Saddleback. I think we would need to leave Biddeford by 8:00 and get to Stonington around 11:00 AM to make this work.

The dashed red lines show an alternative to the solid red route and would have us stay on Harbor Island Saturday night instead of Steve Island. If we stay on Harbor Island we would have to get up a little bit earlier and huff it across Merchants Row first thing.

Having done the blue trip several times, I am favor of trying the solid red line trip (w/ the possibility of using the dashed red route) but I would like to hear from everyone.
