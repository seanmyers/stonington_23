Hey guys, here is the proposed menu for the trip. Please feel free to comment here or on a text thread.

#### Friday Afternoon
_I think we we can grab some breakfast on the way and suffice with GORP for Friday lunch_

#### Friday Night
- _Beans with [[veggie]](https://fieldroast.com/product/signature-stadium-dog/) hot dogs. This looks like a decent [recipe](https://www.campingdude.com/content/recipe/fancy_franks_and_beans-1311.asp)_

#### Saturday Morning
- _breakfast bars_
- _coffee_

#### Saturday Afternoon
- _pita stuffed with cheese, pepperoni, and possibly a veggie_

#### Saturday Night
- _mac and cheese. Here is an example [recipe](http://hapanom.com/camping-mac-n-cheese/)_

#### Sunday Morning
- _breakfast bars_
- _coffee_

I will bring a few packets of dehydrated food in case.
