So we are eight or so weeks away and I know some of you are already thinking about what equipment we need to bring so I thought I would provide some basic information.

It will be later in the season so you should be prepared for highs in the 60's and lows in the 40s. That means bring several layers. You will want to bring two pairs of shoes - one for during the day and one for the evening. Your feet **will** get wet getting in and out of the kayak. I have a [pair of these](https://www.rei.com/product/164638/astral-brewer-20-water-shoes-mens?CAWELAID=120217890014430780&CAGPSPN=pla&CAAGID=104551579641&CATCI=pla-451643129702&cm_mmc=PLA_Google%7C21700000001700551_1646380020%7C92700053581104925%7CTOF%7C71700000066681446&gclsrc=ds&gclsrc=ds) but any old sneaker will do.

We are renting 16' kayaks that should have two cavities for equipment one large one in the back and a smaller one up front. It is better to have several small packages to stuff in them as opposed to one or two large packages.

This year we have a cabin so we won't need to bring stoves or

Each person should be sure they have the following:
- one 20 liter wet bag to hold your clothes
- one 15 liter bag to hold misc things like food that needs to be shared (we probably only need two plus the one I have).
- one small bag (could be a baggie) to hold personal stuff
- one sleeping bag
- one sleeping pad
- a dish and utensils for meals
- a wool hat for night
- a rain jacket
- a baseball hat or something like that to keep the sun out
- a jack knife if you have one
- a water bottle
- flashlight
- a cup for hot and cold beverages
- a pair of water shoes or sneakers that can get wet
- a dry pair of shoes for the camp
- you may be able to wear shorts but if not a pair of lightweight pants for kayaking during the day

The common things we need are:
- two 5 gallon water containers. I have one.
- lanterns. they have a couple at the cabin bu maybe we consider bringing a spare
- a cooking pot. I have one.
- a frying pan. I have one.
- garbage bags
- can opener
- toilet paper and shovel
- white gas (I can handle this)
- beer/booze (we will buy some beers in Stonington but you can only carry so much beer)
- first aid kit (I have a small one)
- rope (I will grab some)

What am I missing?
