So the dates are set for the kayak trip - September 30 through October 2.

The general itinerary is this:
- leave the Portland area (or wherever we land) on the morning of Friday, the 30th. I think some time around 10:00 AM would work fine. It is a 3 hour drive.
- Once in Stonington, we could take in the sites, grab a beer, or just jump in the kayaks and start paddling.
- I think we would need to head out by 3:00 PM depending on how much daylight we have and how much time we want to paddle. It will take an hour + to get to the island we stayed on before (Steve Island).
- On Saturday (10/1) we can paddle to Isle au Haut and back. Is a nice paddle.
- Head out on Sunday morning (10/2) early so we can leave by 9:00 AM and make it back for the Bills game.

[Here is a link](https://youtu.be/yjMFoO26SA0) to a Youtube video that will introduce you to Stonington. At the 17:30 mark they explore some of the islands we will be going to. We will start with paddling out to Rock Island. We can stop there to adjust our kayaks, etc. From there we will go to Steves Island and if there is a site available to us, setup camp there.
